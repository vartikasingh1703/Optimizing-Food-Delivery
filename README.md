# Optimizing-Food-Delivery
The data scientists at UberEats have a fairly simple goal: getting hot food delivered quickly. Making that happen across the country, though, takes machine learning, advanced statistical modeling and staff meteorologists. In order to optimize the full delivery process, the team has to predict how every possible variable â€” from storms to holiday rushes â€” will impact traffic and cooking time.

## Step 1: Define Project Scope & Goals

### Objective:
To predict food delivery time while considering variables such as weather, traffic levels, and preparation time. The goal is to reduce delays and optimize the full delivery process.

## Key Challenges:
 1. Impact of weather conditions on delivery
 2. Effects of traffic congestion on delivery time
 3. Optimization of preparation and dispatch times
 4. Choosing the most efficient delivery vehicle type
    
### Key Features in Dataset
 â€¢ Delivery Person Details â†’ Age, Experience, Ratings
 â€¢ Location Data â†’ Latitude, Longitude of Restaurant & Delivery
 â€¢ Order & Delivery Timing â†’ Order Time, Picked Time
 â€¢ Weather & Traffic â†’ Road conditions, Traffic density, Weather
 â€¢ Order Details â†’ Type of Order, Vehicle Type, Multiple Deliveries
 â€¢ Special Events â†’ Festivals, Urban vs. Metropolitan Areas

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
â€¢ Convert Date & Time Fields: Order_Date, Time_Orderd, Time_Order_picked
â€¢ Calculate Order-to-Pickup Time: Pickup_Delay = Time_Order_picked - Time_Orderd
â€¢ Calculate Distance Using Haversine Formula (Great-circle distance)
â€¢ Convert Categorical Data to Numerical
â€¢ Handle Missing Data & Outliers
â€¢ Normalize & Scale Features

## Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ðŸ“Š
â€¢ Impact of Weather & Traffic on delivery times
â€¢ Vehicle Type vs. Delivery Speed
â€¢ Impact of Festival Days on Delays
â€¢ Are older delivery agents faster or slower?
â€¢ Effect of Multiple Deliveries on Time Taken

## Step 4: Feature Engineering & Model Selection ðŸ¤–
â€¢ Distance Between Locations
â€¢ Traffic Density & Weather Conditions
â€¢ Delivery Personâ€™s Ratings & Age
â€¢ Type of Vehicle Used
â€¢ Festival Days (Yes/No)

## Step 5: Model Training & Evaluation ðŸŽ¯
ðŸ“Œ Train-Test Split: 80% Train, 20% Test
ðŸ“Œ Metrics to Evaluate:
âœ… Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
âœ… Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
âœ… RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

##Final Outcome:
A machine learning model that accurately predicts food delivery time, considering traffic, weather, delivery personnel efficiency, and order details. This will help UberEats optimize delivery operations and reduce customer wait times.
